## What is Braid?
Braid is a pattern library tool for Laravel (+ Livewire) projects.

It enables developers to view components and markup in isolation, allowing for a consistent, clutter-free view of the atomic structure of their layouts.

## Installing Braid
Braid can be installed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```
$ composer require njpanderson/braid
```
