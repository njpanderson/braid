Braid works by scanning the `Tests/Patterns` namespace for pattern definitions representing individual view files in your project.

Each pattern definitionâ€™s location is used to infer the associated view location automatically. For instance, with a Pattern definition at:

`Tests\Patterns\Components\Button`

The view would loaded as:

`components.button`

Which is then resolved internally by Laravel to load the correct view as a distinct pattern.

## Setting up a pattern definition
Pattern definitions come in three types:

 - **Basic** (for any embedded .blade.php file)
 - **Component** (for [Laravel components](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/blade#components))
 - **Livewire** (for [Livewire components](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/components))

A pattern must extend one of these base classes in order to be correctly registered. For example, a **basic** pattern class could look like this:

{% include basic-pattern.md %}

ðŸ¤– Braid will automatically load the pattern using slightly different techniques depending n the pattern definitionâ€™s parent class, so regardless of where you put your patterns, the class they extend is important.

## Creating a pattern
You can create patterns in two ways: either by using the `braid:make:pattern` artisan command, or by manually creating a PHP file.

The following command can be used to create pattern files, for example:

```shell
php artisan braid:make:pattern Button --type=component
```

This will create a single class within `tests/Patterns` as follows:

```php
namespace Tests\Patterns;

use Illuminate\View\View;
use njpanderson\Braid\Base\ComponentPattern;
use njpanderson\Braid\Contracts\PatternContext;

class Button extends ComponentPattern {
    /**
     * Pattern contexts
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $contexts = [];

    public function contextData(string $context): PatternContext|View
    {
        return $this->makeContext();
    }
}
```

Two other types of pattern definitions can be made. `BasicPattern` (`--type=basic`), for simple, view-based partials with no component structure, and `LivewirePattern` (`--type=livewire`), for targeting livewire components.

**Hint:** If you ever forget which types are available, or how to use the make command, just run `php artisan braid:make:pattern --help`

### Optimal directory structure
If you want to stick to the automatic view resolution, then itâ€™s best to match your view file structure within the patterns namespace. I.e. put your Laravel component patterns in `Tests\Patterns\Components` and your livewire patterns in `Tests\Patterns\Livewire` â€” just as the view files are generally located.

This is optional, but will mean you don't need to define the view location on each pattern.

## Manual view definition
Automatic view resolution will mean you don't need to specify view files manually, however if you need a pattern to point somewhere else, a change to your pattern definition class can be made:

```php
    /**
     * Name of the view, overrides view resolution.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected string $viewName = '<your.view.name>';
```
