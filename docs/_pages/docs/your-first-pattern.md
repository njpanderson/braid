Braid works by scanning the `Tests/Patterns` namespace for pattern definitions representing individual view files in your project.

Each pattern definitionâ€™s location is used to infer the associated view file automatically. For instance, with a Pattern definition at:

`Tests\Patterns\Components\Button`

The view will loaded from:

`components.button`

Which will be resolved internally by Laravel to load the correct view as a distinct pattern.

## Setting up a pattern definition
Pattern definitions come in three types:

 - **Basic** (for any partial .blade.php file)
 - **Component** (for Laravel components)
 - **Livewire** (for Livewire components)

A pattern must extend one of these base classes in order to be correctly registered. For example, a **basic** pattern class could look like this:

{% include basic-pattern.md %}

ðŸ™ˆ In reality, there isnâ€™t a huge difference between the three base classes at the moment, but itâ€™s still best to keep them distinct as future upgrades to Braid may require it.

## Creating a pattern
You can create patterns in two ways: either by using the `braid:make:pattern` artisan command, or by manually creating a PHP file.

The following command can be used to create pattern files, for example:

```shell
php artisan braid:make:pattern Button --type=component
```

This will create a single class within `tests/Patterns` as follows:

```php
namespace Tests\Patterns;

use Illuminate\View\View;
use njpanderson\Braid\Base\ComponentPattern;
use njpanderson\Braid\Contracts\PatternContext;

class Button extends ComponentPattern {
    /**
     * Pattern contexts
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $contexts = [];

    public function contextData(string $context): PatternContext|View
    {
        return $this->makeContext();
    }
}
```

Two other types of pattern definitions can be made. `BasicPattern`, for simple, view-based partials with no component structure, and `LivewirePattern`, for targeting livewire components.

### Optimal directory structure
If you want to stick to the automatic view resolution, then itâ€™s best to match your view file structure within the patterns namespace. I.e. put your Laravel component patterns in `Tests\Patterns\Components` and your livewire patterns in `Tests\Patterns\Livewire` â€” just as the view files are generally located.

This is optional, but will mean you don't need to manually define your view locations each time.

## Manual view definition
Automatic view resolution will mean you don't need to specify view files manually, however if you need a pattern to point somewhere else, a simple change to your pattern definition class can be made:

```php
    /**
     * Name of the view, overrides view resolution.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected string $viewName = '<your.view.name>';
```
